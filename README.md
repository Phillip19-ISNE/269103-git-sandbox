# Exercise 11: Learn GitHub - Branch and Merge

## Instructions

* Fork this repo (original repo) to your GitHub account.
* Clone the forked repo to your local machine.
* On your local machine:
  * Create a new branch using `git checkout -b YOUR_STUDENT_ID` (replace YOUR_STUDENT_ID with your actual student ID).
  * Answer the questions below by editing this `README.md` file. You may refer to course materials but may NOT copy from other students.
  * After answering all questions, commit your changes.
  * Run the command `git log --oneline > YOUR_STUDENT_ID.log` to save your commit history to a file named with your student ID.
  * Add this log file to Git and commit this addition to your branch.
  * Switch to main branch using `git checkout main`, then merge your branch using `git merge YOUR_STUDENT_ID`. Do NOT delete your branch after merging.
  * Push all changes to your remote repo on GitHub.
* On GitHub:
  * Create a pull request (PR) to the original repo
  * Use **YOUR_STUDENT_ID** as the PR title
  * Submit by **Friday Febuary 27, 2024 1:00pm (GMT+7)**.
  * Leave the PR open after submission.
* Your PR must include the following:
  * Your answers of all questions.
  * Your commit history log file (`YOUR_STUDENT_ID.log`).
  * Note: Late submissions or PRs not visible in the original repo will NOT be graded.

## Questions

1. Name two Linux commands from this course that you found most valuable. For each:
   * Briefly describe its function
   * Explain why it's essential for new engineers (in your own words)

**Answer:** 
1. ls  
Function: The ls command lists files and directories in the current directory.  
It helps new engineers quickly understand the structure of a project and see what files are available before editing or running anything.

2. grep  
Function: The grep command searches for specific text or patterns inside files.  
It is very useful when working with large projects because engineers can quickly find keywords, error messages, or specific lines of code instead of reading everything manually.

2. After one and a half years in the ISNE program, what advice would you give to prospective ISNE students? (Minimum 50 words)

**Answer:** 
After one and a half years in the ISNE program, I would advise prospective students to practice consistently and manage their time well. Some subjects such as programming and networking may feel difficult at first, but regular practice makes them easier over time. Do not hesitate to ask questions from lecturers or friends when you do not understand something. Working in study groups can help you learn faster and stay motivated. Most importantly, stay patient and keep improving step by step.
